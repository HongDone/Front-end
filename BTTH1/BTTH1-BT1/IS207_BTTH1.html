                                The ragdoll cat is a large, 
                                affectionate cat that goes with the flow. 
                                Ragdolls are ideal lap cats because they simply go 
                                limp with pleasure when they are being petted, giving them their name. 
                                This cat breed is one of the largest, but don’t let the size intimidate you.

                                The exotic shorthair cat has been called the "lazy" person's Persian because it shares
                                the Persian cat's facial features but has a shorter coat that requires less grooming.
                                Exotic shorthairs are soft, medium-sized cats that tend to develop strong bonds with 
                                their owners, get along with other pets and kids, and have sweet personalities.

                                The British Shorthair is the pedigreed version of the traditional British domestic cat, 
                                with a distinctively stocky body, thick coat, and broad face. The most familiar colour 
                                variant is the "British Blue", with a solid grey-blue coat, pineapple eyes, and a 
                                medium-sized tail.

                                The Persian cat has been cherished for hundreds—if not thousands—of years, tracing its 
                                origins to the deserts of Persia and Iran. Today, the Persian cat is the most popular
                                pedigreed cat breed in the U.S.. The Persian cat is a medium- to large-sized breed.

                                Despite the length of the Maine Coon’s coat, it has a silky texture that doesn’t mat
                                easily—if you groom it regularly. It is easily cared for with twice weekly combing to
                                remove dead hair and distribute skin oils. Useful grooming tools include a stainless steel
                                comb for removing tangles and what’s called a “grooming rake” to pull out dead undercoat.

                                Formerly used to keep rodents and vermin away from food stores, the American Shorthair 
                                still enjoys exercising her hunting skills on unsuspecting insects. As a smart, 
                                moderately active feline, she enjoys learning tricks and challenging her intelligence
                                with puzzles and interactive toys.
